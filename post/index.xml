      <description>Notes Notes This initial problem instantiates how knowledge evolves via communication of agents that begin without knowing their own states. One possible enunciation is as follows:
A group of children is playing in the garden, and some of them end up with mud on their foreheads. Each child can see the other children&amp;rsquo;s foreheads but not his or her own. At noon, their teacher summons the children and says: &amp;ldquo;At least one of you has a muddy forehead.</description>

      <description>Notes Definitions Coloring Maps Constructions Notes Definitions The representation via graphs is limited to at most one failing process, allowing for more on the analysis of specific cases such as consensus with synchronous communication. In order to study general tasks with models where more than once process can fail, simplicial complexes are useful, as higher order graphs.
A simplicial complex in the combinatorial view is a pair \(\cal K = (V,S)\), where \(V\) is a finite set of vertices and \(S \subseteq \mathcal{P}(V)\) is a set of simplices, non-empty subsets of \(V\), where:</description>

      <description>Notes Notes This problem shows how in some cases failures in communication is enough for making it impossible to reach a decision. The enunciation of the problem is as follows.
Two army division, one commanded by general ALice and one by general Bob, are camped on two hilltops overlooking a valley, The enemy is camped in the valley. If both divisions attack simultaneously, they will win, but if only one division attacks by itself, it will be defeated.</description>
