      <description>Notes Notes This initial problem instantiates how knowledge evolves via communication of agents that begin without knowing their own states. One possible enunciation is as follows:
A group of children is playing in the garden, and some of them end up with mud on their foreheads. Each child can see the other children&amp;rsquo;s foreheads but not his or her own. At noon, their teacher summons the children and says: &amp;ldquo;At least one of you has a muddy forehead.</description>

      <description>Notes Notes This problem shows how in some cases failures in communication is enough for making it impossible to reach a decision. The enunciation of the problem is as follows.
Two army division, one commanded by general ALice and one by general Bob, are camped on two hilltops overlooking a valley, The enemy is camped in the valley. If both divisions attack simultaneously, they will win, but if only one division attacks by itself, it will be defeated.</description>
