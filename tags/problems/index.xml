      <description>Notes Notes This initial problem instantiates how knowledge evolves via communication of agents that begin without knowing their own states. One possible enunciation is as follows:
A group of children is playing in the garden, and some of them end up with mud on their foreheads. Each child can see the other children&amp;rsquo;s foreheads but not his or her own. At noon, their teacher summons the children and says: &amp;ldquo;At least one of you has a muddy forehead.</description>
