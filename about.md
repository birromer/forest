I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/">Institute of Informatics</a> at the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home">Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul</a>.

I am a member of the <a href="https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/phi-group/site/">Phi Robotics Research Lab</a> as part of a scientific initiation program. I'm also part of <a href="http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/pet/">PET Computação</a> on UFRGS, where I study and apply data science solutions to problems on our community.

I'm interested in mobile robotics, mainly visual SLAM and interval analysis, and data science. I currently study image feature detectors and descriptors for visual place recognition.
