      <description>Notes segundo item Notes This second problem shows how in some cases failures in communication is enough for making it impossible to reach a decision. The enunciation of the problem is as follows.
Two army division, one commanded by general ALice and one by general Bob, are camped on two hilltops overlooking a valley, The enemy is camped in the valley. If both divisions attack simultaneously, they will win, but if only one division attacks by itself, it will be defeated.</description>

Rob J Hyndman&amp;rsquo;s personal website. Live Free or Dichotomize by Lucy and Nick et al. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more.</description>

      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.
1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
