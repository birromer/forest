<div class="introduction">
  <h1>hi.</h1>

<p>
  So, this is an attempt on my wish to pick up the habit of documenting
  slash writing down stuff that I have learned and wish not to forget.
</p>
<p>
  You'll probably find this to be very poorly updated and with contents 
  that have little to no connection. Happens.

<div class="toc">
  <h2>the stuff</h2>
  <ul class="texts">
  {% for item in site.texts %}

    <li class="text-title">
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ item.url }}">
        {{ item.title }}
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
