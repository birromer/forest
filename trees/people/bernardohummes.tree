\p{
  I'm a PhD student at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) working on formal methods for mobile robotics with [Eric Goubault](ericgoubault), [Sylvie Putot](sylvieputot) and [Luc Jaulin](lucjaulin).
  I study the characterization of tasks in swarm robotics, linkings with methods in distributed computing and the underlying structures in modal logics and topology.}

\p{
  Previously, I completed my masters/engineering degree in autonomous robotics in [ENSTA Bretagne](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/sperob), where I worked with [Luc Jaulin](lucjaulin) on interval methods for robot localization.
  Before that, I did a bachelors in computer science in [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/), where I worked in its [robotics lab](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/phi-group/site/) on hybrid methods for robot localization and monocular vision in loop closure.
