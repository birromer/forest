\p{
  I'm a PhD student at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) working on formal methods for mobile robotics with [Eric Goubault](ericgoubault), [Sylvie Putot](sylvieputot) and [Luc Jaulin](lucjaulin). I work on characterizing the solvability of tasks performed by swarms of robots, connecting distributed computing and mobile robotics with the underlying structures in modal logics and topology.

\p{
  Previously, I completed my masters/engineering degree in autonomous robotics in [ENSTA Bretagne](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/sperob), where I worked with [Luc Jaulin](lucjaulin) on interval methods for robot localization.
  Before that, I did a bachelors in computer science in [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en), where I worked in its [robotics lab](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/phi-group/site/) on hybrid methods for robot localization and monocular vision in loop closure.
